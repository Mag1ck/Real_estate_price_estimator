## Features

- **Data preprocessing** for real estate datasets
- **Feature engineering** to extract meaningful features
- **Machine learning model** to predict property prices
- **Model evaluation** and performance metrics

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip (Python package installer)**

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mag1ck/Real_estate_price_estimator.git
cd Real_estate_price_estimator
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

- **Load your dataset** into the **data.csv** or use fetch_links then fetch_data to get new data from Otodom.pl.

### Training model, Making predicitions and evaluating the model

- **Run untitled.ipynb** you can modify whole background code to set it to your preferences, there are also plots including distribution of price per square foot and prices on "Ursus" state (you can modify everything and set to your preferences)

### Using the server

- **cd** to **/server/** and run **server.py**
